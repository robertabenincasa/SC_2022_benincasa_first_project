# SC_2022_benincasa_first_project

The aim of this project is to implement a cellular automata following rules 30, 90, 110 and 184 by Wolfram. The system is defined by a string of ' 0 ' and ' . ' representing alive and dead cells, respectively. Wolfram's rules provide a way to evolve the system thanks to the knowledge of the state of each cell and its 2 closest neighbours. The simulation always starts from an initial state composed of only one alive cell. The adopted boundary conditions could be choosen among reflective, periodic and constant ones.
